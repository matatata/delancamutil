  @class UVCType
  @abstract Abstract data type comprised of UVCTypeComponentType atomic types
  
  Instances of the UVCType class represent the structured data brokered by
  UVC controls.  A UVCType comprises one or more named data structure fields in
  a specific order, with each having an atomic type from the
  UVCTypeComponentType enumeration.
  
  The set of fields correlate to a packed C struct without word boundary padding;
  this also correlates directly to the format of UVC control data.
  
  In case this code were to be compiled on a big-endian host, byte-swapping
  routines are included which can reorder an external buffer (containing the
  UVC control data structured by the UVCType) to and from USB (little) endian.
  
  Methods are included to calculate relative byte offsets of the component fields,
  either by index of the name of the field.  Also, the number of bytes occupied
  by the UVCType is available via the byteSize method.
  
  Methods are also provided to initialize an external buffer structured by a
  UVCType using textual input (from a C string).

  @method scanCString:intoBuffer:flags:minimum:maximum:stepSize:defaultValue:
  
  The arguments buffer, minimum, maximum, stepSize, and defaultValue are all assumed to be at least as
  large as the receiver's [self byteSize] method would return.  If any of minimum, maximum, stepSize, or
  defaultValue are non-NULL, they are assumed to contain the corresponding limit data read from the UVC
  device.
  
  Parses cString and attempts to fill-in the provided buffer according to the receiver's component fields.
  The component values must be contained within curly braces, and values should be delimited using a
  comma.  Whitespace is permissible around words and commas.
  
  Use of a floating-point (fractional) value for a component requires that minimum and maximum are non-NULL.
  The fractional value maps to the correponding value in that range, with 0.0f being the minimum.
  
  The words "default," "minimum," and "maximum" are permissible on components so long as minimum,
  maximum, or defaultValue are non-NULL.
  
  Receivers with a single component may omit the curly braces.
  
  If the words "default," "minimum," or "maximum" are the entirety of cString, then the corresponding
  value is set for all component fields, provided the corresponding pointer argument is non-NULL.
  
  The flags bitmask controls this function's behavior.  At this time, the only flags present enable
  informative output to stderr as the parsing progresses.
  
  Returns YES if all component fields of the receiver were successfully set in the provided buffer.
  
  Examples:
    
    Type            Value
    {S2}            "25"
    {S2}            "{=25}" (same as previous)
    {S2 x; S2 y;}   "{0,1}"
    {S2 x; S2 y;}   "{y=1,x=0}" (same as previous)
    {S2 w; S2 h;}   "{h=minimum,w=default}" (provided minimum and defaultValue are non-NULL)
    {S2 w; S2 h;}   "{default,minimum}" (same as previous)
